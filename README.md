Segmentation of cells using bayesian neural networks for a certainty metric

### Dataset

We created a custom data set based on the training set of images and labels provided by Kaggle for the 2018 Data Science Bowl. This dataset is composed of images of nuclei (cell nuclei).  The challenge aims to develop an algorithm capable of easily detecting and segmenting cell nuclei in order to count them, identify cancer cells from healthy cells, identify and track their movements in order to observe a patient's response to treatment at the molecular level. The kaggle dataset is therefore composed of cell nuclei acquired by different instruments and under different illumination, magnification and other modalities (fluorescence) The image data are in RGB format while the labels are RGB but with binary behaviour (0, 255).

Examples of images in data :
